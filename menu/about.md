title: About

I'm a mathematics teacher at The New School, New York University, and the Borough of Manhattan Community College.  I received my PhD from Columbia University under the direction of Dr. Bruce Vogeli with my dissertation *Architectures of the Mathematical Child*.  My interests are in thinking differently about mathematics and schooling.

Please contact me if you need any help making use of the materials or have questions on their use.
